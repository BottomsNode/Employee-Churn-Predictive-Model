# Employee Churn Predictive Model

## Problem Statement

Employee turnover can significantly impact an organization's productivity and morale. Understanding the reasons behind employee attrition is crucial for implementing strategies to improve retention and plan for future staffing needs. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify the likelihood of an employee leaving the company and uncovering key indicators driving churn.

## Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/) dataset, comprising information on 1,470 employees. Attributes include demographics, job roles, performance ratings, and satisfaction scores. It's important to note that this dataset is fictional, created by IBM data scientists for demonstration purposes.

## Methodology

This project follows a systematic approach:

- **Data Exploration:** Understand the dataset's structure, identify missing values, and explore distributions.
- **Feature Engineering:** Select relevant features, preprocess data, and encode categorical variables.
- **Model Development:** Train and evaluate machine learning algorithms for churn prediction, optimizing performance with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identify key drivers of churn using feature importance techniques.
- **Policy Recommendations:** Propose actionable strategies based on model insights to mitigate churn and improve retention.
